# Writing Guidelines (wip)

## Images and Video
1. Make sure images have a descriptive file name with the number prefix being the order they appear in the article
2. All images must be .jpg, .jpeg, or .png with a strong preference twords .jpg.
3. Locally hosted videos can be added just like images in .mp4 or .webm format. File sizes must be under 50mb. See example below for HTML tagging of video.
```
{{< video src="images/cloning_panels_cc.webm" controls="yes" >}}
```


## Structure and URL
1. Folder name should match what we want the url to be ie. linus-rust-drama-cosmic-alpha. Also, going forward we 
will dis-include the url template tag so that news article fall under a date scheme in the url bar.
