## ‚úÖ Basic Requirements

The TechHut YouTube channel is always open to sponsorships and partners if there is a benefit for all parties involved. With this said, the most important party in any agreement is the viewer. If there isn‚Äôt an inherent benefit to the viewer there will be no agreement. Below I will list some important notes that possible advertisers and partners should keep note of.
* We have strong leaning and preference to Linux and free and open-source software. Free and open source is not necessary, but a Linux version of any software advertised is strongly preferred.
* Data collection policies must be open and transparent. Any unusual wording or sharing of customer data with 3rd parties is likely to result in a declining of partnership.

## üì¶ Review Units and Policy

We accept review units and products sent to the address below. Please verify with us before sending something as we can‚Äôt produce content for everything. Items can be sent as a gift, in exchange for a particular service, or with an item loan agreement. In a majority of cases, we will need 30 days to test a product. If we‚Äôre required to send an item back, we will need a return label and postage.\

## üìà Advertising Services

* üìÑ Sponsor Segment: [UGREEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC67FoXVRPE)
* üé• Dedicated video: [Twingate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaw2A3DG664)
* üìé Placement: [Acemagic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPg5f9xEjVE)



### üìÑ Sponsor Segments
These are the most common form of advertising on the TechHut channel. These sponsor segments are typically 15-60 second advertisements within the first 3 minutes of a video. Prices range depending on duration, location in content, and length of agreement. Typically, we charge a CPM rate of $15 for 30 days or a flat rate depending on factors listed above.

### üé• Dedicated videos
This can consist of a complete walk-through of a product or service, highlight major software updates, or if you have hardware that needs a sponsored unboxing/demonstration. We will not agree to a ‚Äúsponsored review‚Äù where we‚Äôre required to give specific opinions or recommendations. We will always be allowed to voice any criticism of any product and we also hold the right to back out of any deal if a product or service doesn‚Äôt meet strict quality standards. Sponsored event coverage falls in this category.

### üìé Placements might
This be a good option whether that means description links, pinned comments, on-screen graphics, using a product to accomplish a larger goal, products in shot/backgrounds, or quick sponsor segments at the end of videos.

_*These are general categories that a majority of deals fall in. If you have a specific need or request, feel free to reach out with any proposals._



‚ÄúLinode‚Äôs partnership with TechHut Media for the last 2 years has been a winning part of our marketing strategy. We naturally fit in with the kind of technology his audience is interested in, and Brandon regularly comes forward with great ideas for both integrated and dedicated placements that feature our brand in exciting new ways. TechHut is one of the few channels we sponsor that feels more like an extension of our marketing efforts and messaging rather than just a simple sponsored mention for hire.‚Äù
