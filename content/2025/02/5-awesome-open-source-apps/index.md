## [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)

The Zen Web Browser is a customisable browser built on Firefox's engine, offering a lightweight and fast experience without compromising privacy or security. It’s designed to be more intuitive than other browsers like Chrome or Firefox by providing Zen Mods, which are highly customisable addons tailored to individual needs—often surpassing the functionality of generic browser extensions.

Zen Mods focus on productivity and user satisfaction while maintaining Firefox's core privacy features, such as built-in trackers removal and advanced ad-blocker capabilities.

### Self-Hosted Alternatives

Now, I generally prefer self-hosting or non-streaming depenant applications. Here are some I would recommened if Apple Music isn't your thing.

- [PlexAMP](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/): Ideal for Plex Pass users seeking a dedicated music client.
- [Strawberry](https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org): Open source desktop client with a classic feel.
- [Tauon](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/): This is a modern feature rich music client.

## [Betterbird Email Client](https://www.betterbird.eu/)

Betterbird is a refined version of Mozilla Thunderbird, offering improvements and exclusive features over traditional email clients. It boasts a multi-line view akin to Outlook or Lotus Notes, vertical tabs for better organization, customizable header pane options, and enhanced attachment management compared to standard Thunderbird versions.

While Thunderbird faced critical issues like data loss in certain POP setups and IMAP failures, Betterbird addresses these with fixes that restore functionality post-folder repairs. The 128.x series has seen several updates, each improving specific areas without introducing regressions, ensuring a stable user experience.

Easily integrable with existing Thunderbird profiles, Betterbird allows seamless coexistence, enabling users to switch effortlessly based on their needs.
